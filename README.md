## Why I created Fractions?

Lately, I've started a blog on Medium and tried to share my programming knowledge, even though it is not so much. One day, while wandering around my MPP Dashboard, I looked up the sources (JSON) of the page and noticed there is a bulk of unusued data about almost anyhting about my page, and Medium doesn't even bother to show them to me.

So, I decided to use this data to create a Chrome extension for anyone who is interested. The primary concern of this extension is to show you your **net** earnings, without the taxes you have to pay. To make things interesting, I added a level system on top of stats that you can pass each level, simply by earning or writing more.

By the way, you might be thinking what the duck is **Fractions**? Well, it is the name of tech publication I run. Feel free to [check it out](https://medium.com/fractions), as well.

## How is it different from Partner Dashboard?

In Partner Dashboard, all we get is monthly and referred member earnings. There's no stat about what I earned yesterday, total member time, or the net earnings without taxes. So, I made this Chrome extension as a total replacement for Partner Dashboard. It includes everything Partner Dashboard, but adds more [features](#) on top of them, using the data scattered around.

## Features

- Daily total member reading time
